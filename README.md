## Why?

This isn't a crazy new idea. Other ecosystems like Perl's CPAN have been benefiting from a common readme format for years. Furthermore:

    The node community is powered by us people and the modules we share. It's our documentation that links us together. Our README is the first thing developers see and it should be maximally effective at communicating its purpose and function.

    There is much wisdom to be found from the many developers who have written many many modules. Common readme aims to distill that experience into a common format that stands to benefit us all; especially newer developers!

    Writing the same boilerplate is a waste of every author's time -- we might as well generate the common pieces and let the author focus on the content.

    Scanning through modules on npm is a part of every node developer's regular development cycle. Having a consistent format lets the brain focus on content instead of structure.

## Install

With npm installed, run

npm install -g common-readme

You can now execute the common-readme command.
## Acknowledgments

A standard readme format for the Node community isn't a new idea. Inspiration came from many conversations and unrealized efforts in the community:

    standard/standard#141
    richardlitt/standard-readme
    zwei/standard-readme

This, in addition to my own experiences evaluating hundreds of node modules and their READMEs.

I was partly inspired by the audacity of the honey-badger-don't-care efforts of standard.

I also did a great deal of Perl archaeology -- it turns out the monks of the Perl community already did much of the hard work of figuring out great READMEs and the wisdom around small module development well over a decade ago.

Thanks to @mafintosh, @andrewosh, and @feross for many long conversations about readmes and Node.
